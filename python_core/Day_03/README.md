# Day 3 – Control Flow in Python (if / else & Loops)

Welcome to **Day 3** of my **Python Zero to Advanced Journey**.  
Today’s focus was on **Control Flow**, which allows a program to make decisions and repeat tasks intelligently.

This is one of the most important foundations of real-world programming.

## 📌 Topics Covered Today

### 1️⃣ Conditional Statements (if / elif / else)
- Making decisions based on conditions
- Executing different code blocks for different inputs

### 2️⃣ Loops
- `while` loop → run code while a condition is true
- `for` loop → iterate over a collection (list, range, etc.)

## 🧠 Programs Written Today

### ✅ Program 1: Number Check (if / else)
**Concepts used:**
- User input
- Integer conversion
- Conditional logic

**What it does:**
- Takes a number from the user
- Checks whether it is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**

**Real-life use cases:**
- Validating user input (age, balance, marks)
- Login checks (correct / incorrect credentials)
- Decision-based systems (eligibility, permissions)

---

### ✅ Program 2: While Loop (Repetition)
**Concepts used:**
- Loop condition
- Counter variable

**What it does:**
- Prints numbers from 1 to 5

**Real-life use cases:**
- Retry systems (keep asking until valid input)
- Background services
- Game loops
- Server health checks

---

### ✅ Program 3: For Loop (Iteration)
**Concepts used:**
- Iterating over a list
- Automatic value assignment

**What it does:**
- Prints each item from a list of fruits

**Real-life use cases:**
- Processing database records
- Reading files line by line
- Looping through API responses
- Automation scripts
