# Day 4 – Python Operators

Welcome to **Day 4** of my **Python Zero to Advanced Journey**.  
Today’s focus was on **Python Operators**, which are used to perform calculations, comparisons, and logical decisions inside a program.

Operators are a core concept because **almost every program uses them** in some form.

## 📌 Topics Covered Today

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
- Performing mathematical calculations
- Operators used:
  - `+` Addition
  - `-` Subtraction
  - `*` Multiplication
  - `/` Division
  - `%` Modulus
  - `//` Floor Division
  - `**` Exponentiation

---

### 2️⃣ Comparison Operators
- Comparing two values and returning a boolean result (`True` or `False`)
- Operators used:
  - `==` Equal to
  - `!=` Not equal to
  - `>` Greater than
  - `<` Less than
  - `>=` Greater than or equal to
  - `<=` Less than or equal to

---

### 3️⃣ Logical Operators
- Used to combine or reverse conditions
- Operators used:
  - `and` → True if all conditions are true
  - `or` → True if at least one condition is true
  - `not` → Reverses the condition result

---

### 4️⃣ Assignment Operators
- Used to assign and update variable values
- Operators used:
  - `=`
  - `+=`
  - `-=`
  - `*=`
  - `/=`
